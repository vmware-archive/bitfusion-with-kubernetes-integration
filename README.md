# Bitfusion with Kubernetes Integration

This project is a collection of tools for Bitfusion to be used with Kubernetes and Docker. For more information about Bitfusion, visit [vSphere Bitfusion document page](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere-Bitfusion/index.html). This project contains:

- [Bitfusion device plugin for Kubernetes](./bitfusion_device_plugin)
- [Dockerfile templates for Bitfusion client](./Dockerfiles)
- [Shell scripts to accelerate the deployment](./nvidia-env.sh)

## Features

- [Bitfusion device plugin](./bitfusion_device_plugin) provides the interface for applications to request Bitfusion GPU resources via Kubernetes native mechanism. Also, it could help to bake Bitfusion client image automatically.
- [Dockerfile templates](./Dockerfiles) show Bitfusion client Docker image file samples, which could help to build customized Bitfusion application Docker images.
- [Shell script](./nvidia-env.sh) is provided to build Bitfusion execution environment automatically.

## Usage

- For device plugin, refer to [this page](./bitfusion_device_plugin/README.md) for more usage information.
- Dockerfile templates are located in the directory [./Dockerfiles](./Dockerfiles) to set up a Bitfusion client based on different OS automatically. After deployment, you could run `bitfusion smi` command to check remote GPU resource of Bitfusion server connected to this Bitfusion client.
- [nvidia-env.sh](./nvidia-env.sh) is a shell script to install needed various dependencies of Bitfusion client.
